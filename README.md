# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## Background
In this project, I create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. It reveals that a small handful of microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Dependencies
- D3.js
- Plotly.js

## Acknowledgements
This project is based on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provided by BC edX.
